## Introduction

Welcome to Lefarm.com, your one-stop destination for fresh farm products directly from highly productive villages to the market. Our mission is to bridge the gap between farmers and customers, making it easier for farmers to sell their produce and for customers to buy fresh products conveniently.

## Project Inspiration üå±

The inspiration for Lefarm.com came from the lack of reliable means of connecting farmers from my village, which is highly productive, to the market where those products would be sold. Growing up in this village, I witnessed firsthand the challenges that farmers face in accessing markets. This project is a way to give back to my community and empower farmers with technology.

## Technologies Used üíª
For the frontend, we chose to use HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript without any additional frameworks. We opted not to use other frameworks because we wanted to dedicate our time to solidifying our understanding of JavaScript. For the backend, we used Flask, a lightweight Python framework, and SQLAlchemy for database management. This choice was based on the simplicity and flexibility of Flask, which allowed us to focus on building the core functionality of the application.

## Core Features üåü

**Product Listings**: Farmers can add new products, and customers can browse and search for products.

**Detailed Product Information**: Customers can view detailed information about each product, including price and description.

**Shopping Cart**: Customers can add products to their cart and proceed to checkout with Mpesa payment integration.

## Most Difficult Technical Challenge üß©

The most challenging aspect of this project was integrating the Mpesa payment system. This process required a deep understanding of API interactions, security considerations, and error handling.

**Situation**: The need to provide a secure and seamless payment experience for users through Mpesa.

**Task**: Integrate the Mpesa API to handle payments on our platform.

**Action**:

- Conducted extensive research on Mpesa's API documentation.
- Implemented OAuth2 for secure token-based authentication.
- Developed a robust error-handling mechanism to manage potential API failures.
- Tested the integration thoroughly to ensure reliability and security.
**Result**: Successfully integrated the Mpesa payment system, ensuring a seamless and secure transaction process for users.
